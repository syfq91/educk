# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to

# rustls-platform-verifier is only reachable through JNI, so R8 treats it as dead code.
# Removing these classes makes every HTTPS request abort the app.
# See the "Proguard" section of the rustls-platform-verifier README.
